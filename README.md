# NationSim
Repository associated with Master thesis project.


This repository contains the Netlogo files, scripts, and R-script used in the "NationSim" project, a master project developed by myself, and serves as both a easy way to access the project and it's constituent parts, as well as a place for readers of the assosiated thesis to look over the concrete data that did not fit into the thesis itself.

The "Netlogo Code" folder contains the code for NationSim itself, as well as the code for all associated prototypes that formed the baseline upon which NationSim was created. All files can easily be loaded into the Netlogo framework and run from there without issue.

The "NationSim example scripts" folder contains serveral pre-defined scripts that can be used with the framework to run specific scenarios, most of which have been discussed in the thesis.

The "R scripts" folder contains the R script written to help decrease the time it takes between generating an output file and creating a correlogram from it.

Finally, the "Example outputs" folder contains both example output files from NationSim simulation runs, as well as Correlograms created with R from said data.
